# ECE-131A---Probability-and-Statistic---Matlab-Project
This is the final Matlab Project which contains 4 questions of simulating some probability concepts and their applications.

The full code is pretty long so I only share a small part of question 2 in which I simulated BEC channel using N-single-parity code.
N-Single-Parity Code is interesting as the receivers are capable of reconstructing the signal as long as no more than 1 bit being erasured. 

I got 95/100 for this project because of the minor mistake of misunderstanding another part of question 2.

My report was written in Latex in which I used "mcode" package from Matlab to attach my code in a nicer format.
However, I decided to remove the Appendix part for this public version.
